Part A (33 Points) - Please build a JavaScript Solution that will accomplish the following. 

Use a nested if statement to accomplish the following.

Get two values from the user. The first with be their critical reading score and the second will be their math score.

The scores must be between 200 and 800. Verify that the scores are between 200 and 800 inclusive.

If the applicant has a combined score of over 1200 on the test they will be offered "unconditional" admission to the college.

If the applicant has a score of over 1000 on the test with at least one section either equal to or over 600 they will be offered "provisional" admission to the college.

If the applicant has a combined score that is equal to or greater than 1000 they will be offered "probationary" admission to the college.

Otherwise, they will not be offered admission to the college.

Test your code with varying test scores.
 else {
  if (CriticalReading + MathScore <= 1000){
         msg = "You have offered probationary admission to the college."
         
    }
    else {
     if (CriticalReading + MathScore > 1000 && CriticalReading >= 600 || MathScore >= 600){
         msg = "You have offered provisional admission to the college."
     } 
     else {
       (CriticalReading + MathScore > 1200) 
        msg = "You have offered unconditional admission to the college."
     }
     }
    }
